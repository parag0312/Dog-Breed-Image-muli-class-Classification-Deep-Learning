# Dog-Breed-Image-muli-class-Classification-Deep-Learning
You know you are sitting somewhere and you see a nice cute doggo and you don't know what breed it is . You keep on thinking and you still can't figure out, then some person comes from behind and says 'wow! This Dachshund is soo cute' and you are like Dach.. what.... I don't know about you, but I only know some basic breeds like Golden Retriever, Bull dog, german Shepherd like that.<br>

I have read somewhere,"If you see.... every problem is a problem statement itself".<br>
Now you think! Can I build a Deep learning model which takes image of a dog and predicts it's breed? <br>
Yes I can. There you go!!!!!! <br>


Welcome to my Github repository .<font color='red'>**This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub for Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.**</font>
Code is written in GoogleColab, state of the art notebook which uses Google own GPU. kudos to them for this.
